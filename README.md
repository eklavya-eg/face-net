  Facial Encoding Generator is a project that implements one-shot learning using an Inception-Siamese network trained with PyTorch. It generates facial encodings and provides face verification functionality.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- **One-Shot Learning:** Utilizes an Inception-Siamese network for one-shot learning, allowing effective face recognition with minimal data.
  
- **Facial Encoding Generation:** Generates facial encodings from input images using the trained network.
  
- **Face Verification:** Provides a face verification script to verify the identity of a person against stored facial encodings.
  
- **HDF5 Support:** Stores facial encodings in HDF5 (.h5) file format for efficient data storage and retrieval.

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

1. **Training:** Train the Inception-Siamese network using your dataset.
   
2. **Generating Encodings:** Use the trained model to generate facial encodings from input images.
   
3. **Face Verification:** Verify the identity of a person by comparing their facial encoding against stored encodings.

<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

To get started with Facial Encoding Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
